  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hey there! I'm <strong>Suvan Balasubramaniam</strong>, a passionate <strong>Full Stack Engineer</strong> currently in my 3rd year of study. My journey into tech began purely out of curiosity, and it’s grown into a full-blown passion for crafting clean, scalable, and impactful web applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    I primarily work with <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, and databases like <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I'm also proficient in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and have experience building games and interactive UIs using <strong>pyGame</strong>. I always aim to keep learning and evolving, whether it's adopting new frameworks or optimizing performance and design.
  </p>

  <p>
    My technical toolkit includes skills in <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>Postman</strong>, and <strong>Cloud Hosting (Render, Netlify, Vercel)</strong>. I take pride in writing clean, modular code and enjoy bringing creative solutions to life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of coding, you’ll probably find me strumming a guitar, playing keyboard, singing, or enjoying a good game of badminton or table tennis. I’m also a huge fan of movies — especially anything with a twist!
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, I’m actively looking for <strong>internship opportunities</strong> to grow professionally and work on real-world challenges with awesome teams.
