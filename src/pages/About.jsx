  <h1>About Me</h1>

 <p>
  Hey there! I'm <strong>Suvan Balasubramaniam</strong>, an enthusiastic <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> currently wrapping up my 2nd year of studies. What started as curiosity has grown into a real passion for building clean, user-focused, and scalable web applications.
</p>

<p>
  I primarily work with <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, and relational databases like <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I'm also familiar with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I’ve dabbled with <strong>pyGame</strong> to create simple games and interactive UIs, and I'm always excited to expand my skillset.
</p>

<p>
  I've also built a decentralized application (DApp) on the <strong>ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)</strong> blockchain, which has given me a solid starting point in the world of <strong>Web3</strong> development.
</p>

<p>
  My toolkit includes the fundamentals of <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> and version control with <strong>Git</strong>. I'm beginning to explore areas like <strong>Web3</strong> and will be diving into <strong>DevOps</strong> this May to broaden my understanding of deployment and infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  Outside the code editor, you’ll often find me strumming my guitar, playing keyboard, singing, or enjoying a game of badminton or table tennis. I’m also a movie buff — especially when there's a good twist!
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently seeking <strong>internship opportunities</strong> where I can learn from experienced teams and apply my skills to real-world projects.
